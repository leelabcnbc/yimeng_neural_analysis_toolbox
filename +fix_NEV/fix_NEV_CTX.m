% FIX_NEV_CTX master function to read good trials from NEV file, with CTX file's help if possible.
%
%   NEV_file_name: name of NEV
%   fixing: do we run the fix routines, or just assume everything is
%   fine...
%   trial_template a protobuf class specifying the good trial template.
%   CTX_file_name: name of CTX, leave it empty if you don't have it. can be
%   used for further debugging.
%   throw_high_byte: throw higher byte when reading codes (each code is a 2
%   byte number, and only keep the lower byte).
